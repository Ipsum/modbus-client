      Getting Started
    </h1>
    <p>
      In order to perform the first time setup of your clark Sonic device using
      the Clark Commissioning software, please follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>On the clark Sonic device, insert a jumper aross the pins labeled
      "Commissioning" (JMP1).
      </li>
      <li>Power the device.
      </li>
      <li>If you are using a PC, connect a RS-485 converter between your
      computer's COM port and the 485 port on the device labeled "USER". If
      your computer does not have a COM port, you may have to use a RS-232 to
      USB bridge. Both of these devices can be purchased from Clark or a local
      store.
      </li>
      <li>If you are using a MODBUS RTU master, the device may be configured
      and used with it instead of the clark Sonic Commissioning software. A
      table of registers and values for this purpose can be found in the
      device's user manual.
      </li>
      <li>Install and run the clark Sonic Commissioning software from the
      clarksol.com site or from disk onto the computer to which the clark Sonic
      device is connected.
      </li>
      <li>In the Commissioning software, select the COM port to which the
      device is connected.
      </li>
      <li>Ensure the text on the button on the first screen reads "Jumper is
      ON". If not, press this button.
      </li>
      <li>If the clark Sonic device is not being used on a MODBUS RTU network,
      the communication settings can be left unchanged. Otherwise, set the
      device id, baudrate, and parity which you desire the device to have on
      the MODBUS RTU network.
      </li>
      <li>Press the tab labeled "Unit Settings" and select your desired units
      of measure and media type.
      </li>
      <li>Press the "Apply Changes" button on the bottom left.
      </li>
      <li>You can now remove the Commissioning jumper and place the device in a
      MODBUS network or use the right-hand screen of the clark Sonic
      Commissioning software to check the output of the meter.
      </li>
    </ol>
