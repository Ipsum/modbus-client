    <h1>
      Getting Started
    </h1>
    <p>
      Instructions for first time setup of your clark Sonic device using the
      Clark Commissioning software:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <b>Insert Jumper:</b> A jumper is provided with the clark Sonic device
        in a disconnected position. Insert the jumper across the pins labeled
        "Commissioning" (JMP1).
      </li>
        <br>
      <li>
        <b>Power</b> the clark Sonic device.
      </li>
        <br>
      <li>
        <b>Establish Serial Connection:</b> If you are using a PC, wire the
        3-conductor cable from the energy monitor labeled RS-485 to the model
        43-119 RS-485 converter. Connect the RS-485 converter to your
        computer's COM port. If your computer does not have a COM port, you may
        have to use a RS-232 to USB bridge. This device can be purchased from
        Clark Solutions or a local store.
      </li>
        <br>
      <li>
        <b>Modifying clark Sonic device settings on existing RS-485
        Network:</b> It is recommended that you use your existing MODBUS
        master, but this Commissioning software can be used. See <a href=
        "networked_devices.htm">Networked Devices</a> for more info.
      </li>
        <br>
      <li>
        <b>Using a MODBUS RTU master:</b> The device may be configured and used
        with a MODBUS RTU master (if owned). A table of registers and values for this
        purpose can be found in the clark Sonic device User Manual.
      </li>
        <br>
      <li>
        <b>Installing clark Sonic Commissioning software:</b> The clark Sonic
        Commissioning software may be downloaded from the <a href=
        "http://www.clarksol.com">Clark Solutions</a> website. The installation
        may be run via the web or saved and installed from disk on the computer
        to which the clark Sonic device is connected.
      </li>
        <br>
      <li>
        <b>Configuring clark Sonic device with Commissioning Software:</b>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="COM_port.htm">Select the COM port</a> to which the device
            is connected in the "Comm Settings" tab.
          </li>
          <li>If configuring a single device connected directly to the PC,
          ensure that the software toggle setting for "Jumper" is "ON"
          </li>
          <li>If the clark Sonic device will not be used on a MODBUS RTU
          network, the communication settings can be left unchanged. Otherwise,
          set the device id, baudrate, and parity which you desire the device
          to have on the MODBUS RTU network.
          </li>
          <li>On the <b>"Unit Settings"</b> tab, select your desired units of
          measure and media type.
          </li>
          <li>Press the <b>"Apply Changes"</b> button on the bottom left.
          </li>
          <li>Move the Commissioning jumper to the disconnected position and toggle the "Jumper" setting to "OFF" in the "Comm Settings" tab. 
          </li>
          <li>The clark Sonic device is now
          ready to connect to a MODBUS network or may be monitored via the
          clark Sonic Commissioning software.
          </li>
