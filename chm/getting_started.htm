    <h1>
      Getting Started
    </h1>
    <p>
      In order to perform the first time setup of your clark Sonic device using
      the Clark Commissioning software, please follow these steps:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>On the clark Sonic device, insert a jumper across the pins labeled
      "Commissioning" (JMP1). A jumper is provided in a disconnected position.
      </li>
      <li>Power the device.
      </li>
      <li>If you are using a PC, wire the 3-conductor cable from the energy
      monitor labeled RS-485 to the model 43-119 RS-485 converter. Connect the
      RS-485 converter to your computer's COM port. If your computer does not
      have a COM port, you may have to use a RS-232 to USB bridge. This device
      can be purchased from Clark or a local store.<br>
        <br>
        If you wish to modify the settings of a clark Sonic device already on a
        RS-485 network, we recommend using your existing MODBUS master but this
        Commissioning software can be used. You will need to input the
        communications settings of your existing unit into the Commissioning
        software (Device ID, baudrate, parity) and toggle the "Jumper" setting
        to "OFF". Then, on the device, the commissioning jumper on the board to
        the disconnected/unjumpered position. <b>Communication settings (Device
        ID, baudrate, parity) are not written to the device when the jumper is
        in the disconnected/unjumped position.</b> This is because these
        settings are instead telling the Commissioning software how to
        communicate with the device.<br>
        If you do not know these communications settings or wish to change
        them, apply the jumper to the connected/jumpered position on the
        device. Then, in the software, toggle the "Jumper" setting to "ON".<br>
        <br>
        <i>Note: Installing the Commissioning jumper into the
        connected/jumpered position will temporarily set the communications
        settings of the unit to: Device ID 1, 9600 baud, Parity NONE. This is
        handy if settings of a meter have been forgotten or are unknown. The
        meter resumes normal operation when the jumper is disconnected.</i>
      </li>
      <li>If you are using a MODBUS RTU master, the device may be configured
      and used with it instead of the clark Sonic Commissioning software. A
      table of registers and values for this purpose can be found in the
      device's user manual.
      </li>
      <li>Install and run the clark Sonic Commissioning software from the
      clarksol.com site or from disk onto the computer to which the clark Sonic
      device is connected.
      </li>
      <li>In the Commissioning software, select the COM port to which the
      device is connected.
      </li>
      <li>Ensure the software toggle setting for "Jumper" reads "ON" if
      configuring a single device connected directly to the PC.
      </li>
      <li>If the clark Sonic device is not being used on a MODBUS RTU network,
      the communication settings can be left unchanged. Otherwise, set the
      device id, baudrate, and parity which you desire the device to have on
      the MODBUS RTU network.
      </li>
      <li>Press the tab labeled "Unit Settings" and select your desired units
      of measure and media type.
      </li>
      <li>Press the "Apply Changes" button on the bottom left.
      </li>
      <li>You can now remove the Commissioning jumper and place the device in a
      MODBUS network or use the right-hand screen of the clark Sonic
      Commissioning software to check the output of the meter.
      </li>
