      Getting Started
    </h1>
    <p>
      Instructions for first time setup of your clark Sonic device using the Clark Commissioning software:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li><b>Insert Jumper:</b> A jumper is provided with the clark Sonic device in a disconnected position. Insert the jumper across the pins labeled "Commissioning" (JMP1). 
      </li>
      <li><b>Power</b> the clark Sonic device. 
      </li>
      <li><b>Establish Serial Connection:</b> If you are using a PC, wire the 3-conductor cable from the energy monitor labeled RS-485 to the model 43-119 RS-485 converter. Connect the RS-485 converter to your computer's COM port. If your computer does not have a COM port, you may have to use a RS-232 to USB bridge. This device can be purchased from Clark Solutions or a local store.
</li>
      <li>
        <b>Modifying clark Sonic device settings on existing RS-485 Network:</b> It is recommended that you use your existing MODBUS master, but this Commissioning software can be used. See <A HREF="networked_devices.htm">Networked Devices</A> for more info.
      </li>
      <li><b>Using a MODBUS RTU master:</b> The device may be configured and used with a MODBUS RTU master.. A table of registers and values for this purpose can be found in the clark Sonic device User Manual. 
      </li>
      <li><b>Installing clark Sonic Commissioning software:</b>  The clark Sonic Commissioning software may be downloaded from the <A HREF="http://www.clarksol.com">Clark Solutions</A> website. The installation may be run via the web or saved and installed from disk on the computer to which the clark Sonic device is connected. 
      </li>
      <li><b>Configuring clark Sonic device with Commissioning Software:</b>
      <ul>
      <li> <A HREF="COM_port.htm">Select the COM port</A> to which the device is connected.</li>
      <li> If configuring a single device connected directly to the PC, ensure that the software toggle setting for "Jumper" is "ON" </li>
      <li> If the clark Sonic device will not be used on a MODBUS RTU network, the communication settings can be left unchanged. Otherwise, set the device id, baudrate, and parity which you desire the device to have on the MODBUS RTU network. </li>
      <li>On the <b>"Unit Settings"</b> tab, select your desired units of measure and media type. </li>
      <li>Press the <b>"Apply Changes"</b> button on the bottom left. </li>
      <li>Remove the Commissioning jumper. The clark Sonic device is now ready to connect to a MODBUS network or may be monitored via the clark Sonic Commissioning software.</li>
      </ul>
      </li>
