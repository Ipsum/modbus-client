<h1>Logging</h1>
<p>This page describes how to use the clark Sonic Comissioning software in a data-logging capacity</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>
<ol>
<li>Select the "Logging" tab in the clark Sonic Comissioning software</li>
<li>Press the second button and select the file to log to</li>
<li>Toggle the first button so it says "Logging is Enabled"</li>
<li>You are now logging data</li>
</ol>
<h2>Use</h2>
<p>The logging module of the clark Sonic comissioning software saves the output from a single connected clark Sonic device each time the "Get Data" button is pressed. A timestamp is applied and the log file is formatted as a Comma seperated values file (CSV). This is readable by any conventional spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel. This behavior will continue until the clark Sonic Comissioning software is exited.</p>
