      Logging
    </h1>
    <p>
      This page describes how to use the clark Sonic Commissioning software in a
      data-logging capacity
    </p>
    <h2>
      Setup
    </h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Select the "Logging" tab in the clark Sonic Commissioning software.
      </li>
      <li>Press the "Path" button and select the file to log to.
      </li>
      <li>Toggle the "Logging" button so it says "Enabled".
      </li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
      Use
    </h2>
    <p>
      The logging module of the clark Sonic Commissioning software saves the
      output from a single connected clark Sonic device each time the "Get
      Data" button is pressed. A timestamp is applied and the log file is
      formatted as a comma separated values file (CSV). This is readable by any
      conventional spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel. This behavior
      will continue until the clark Sonic Commissioning software is exited or 
      logging is disabled.
