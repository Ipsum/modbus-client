      Communicating with devices on a network
    </h1>
    <p>
      Follow these instructions to setup the clark Sonic Commissioning software
      to communicate with a clark Sonic device already on a MODBUS RTU network
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>You will need to input the communications settings of your existing
      unit into the Commissioning software (Device ID, baudrate, parity)
      </li>
      <li>Toggle the "Jumper" setting to "OFF".
      </li>
      <li>On the device, the commissioning jumper on the board to the
      disconnected/unjumpered position.
      </li>
      <li>
        <b>Communication settings (Device ID, baudrate, parity) are not written
        to the device when the jumper is in the disconnected/unjumped
        position.</b> This is because these settings are instead telling the
        Commissioning software how to communicate with the device.<br>
      </li>
      <li>If you do not know these communications settings or wish to change
      them, apply the jumper to the connected/jumpered position on the device.
      Then, in the software, toggle the "Jumper" setting to "ON".<br>
      </li>
    </ul><i>Note: Installing the Commissioning jumper into the
    connected/jumpered position will temporarily set the communications
    settings of the unit to: Device ID 1, 9600 baud, Parity NONE. This is handy
    if settings of a meter have been forgotten or are unknown. The meter
    resumes normal operation when the jumper is disconnected.</i>
