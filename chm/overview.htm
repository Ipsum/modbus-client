      Overview
    </h1>The clark Sonic Commissioning Software facilitates the initial setup
    of a clark Sonic Energy Meter by the end user, using the MODBUS RTU
    communication protocol.<br>
    To this end, this software is capable of configuring the unit and
    communication settings of a clark Sonic device connected to a user's PC.
    This software can also read out data from the unit and log this data in a
    limited capacity. This software is not intended to replace a true MODBUS
    master, but will work fine for configuring and interrogating a single unit.
    To interrogate units on a MODBUS network, a real MODBUS master is highly
    recomended.
