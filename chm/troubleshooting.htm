    <h1>
      Troubleshooting
    </h1>
    <p>
      Please follow these general troubleshooting steps first:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Ensure the clark Sonic device is powered.
      </li>
      <li>Ensure a jumper has been inserted across the Commissioning pins of
      the device.
      </li>
      <li>Ensure the clark Sonic device is connected to the computer with the
      Commissioning software installed.
      </li>
      <li>Ensure you have the correct COM port selected in the Commissioning
      software.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Compatible Operating Systems
    </h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Microsoft Windows: XP, Vista, 7
      </li>
      <li>Mac OS X
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h2>
      Error Codes
    </h2>
    <h3>
      The serial port could not be opened
    </h3>
    <p>
      The likely cause of this is an unpowered or disconnected device. Having
      the wrong COM port selected in the clark Sonic Commissioning software
      could also cause this. Finally, another software program trying to use
      the same COM port will also cause this error to display.
    </p>
    <h3>
      A serial communications error has occurred
    </h3>
    <p>
      Recheck the general troubleshooting steps and try again.
    </p>
    <h3>
      There was no response from the meter, please check all connections
    </h3>
    <p>
      The device is either powered off, on a different COM port, or busy. A COM
      port connection was successfully opened, but the meter did not acknowledge
      your message.
    </p>
    <h3>
      The response from the meter was incorrect. Please check that the jumper
      correctly set.
    </h3>
    <p>
      This could be caused by interference or noise in the communication line,
      a problem with the MODBUS network, the wrong device id being selected if
      on a network with other devices, or the device being busy.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Error Reading Config File
    </h3>
    <p>
      If this error persists, your installation of the clark Sonic
      Commissioning software has been corrupted. Please uninstall, redownload,
      and reinstall. This could also be caused by a non-compatible operating
      system. See the top of this file for a list of compatible operating
      systems.
    </p>
    <h3>
      Could not create log file
    </h3>
    <p>
      The directory in which you tried to save the log file might be write
      protected (read only) or the file name might be invalid.
    </p>
